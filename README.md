## My process

### Built with

- [Typescropt](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - desktop testimonials carousel
- [React Swipeable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-swipeable) - mobile testimonials carousel

### What I learned

When faced with mobile testimonials component and how to implement finger swipe I discovered great library 'react-swipeable' , very easy to implement.

### Continued development

Add tablet version, in design there was only desktop and mobile, better style for tablet version.
